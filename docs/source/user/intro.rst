Introduction
============

Writing good tests for your existing deployments or distributed software
infrastructure should be painless, and easily accomplishable without
involving any complex testing setup.

This is where goodplay comes into play.

goodplay instruments ansible_ --- "a radically simple IT automation platform"
as it is advertized --- and allows you to write your tests in the same
familiar language you would write an `ansible playbook`_.
